# dmichos  // Cybersecurity Researcher

Welcome to my digital armory. This repository hosts my professional portfolio, featuring interactive security tools, a simulated cyber academy, and a showcase of my work in vulnerability research and penetration testing.

## 🛠 The Toolshed (Interactive Armory)
A collection of specialized utilities designed for red teaming, exploit development, and web security analysis.

*   **[Reverse Shell Generator](https://dmichos.github.io/pro/reverse-shell.html)**: An interactive payload generator supporting multiple languages (Bash, Python, Perl, PowerShell, Rust, Ruby, etc.) with real-time configuration for LHOST/LPORT and integrated search.
*   **[JWT Local Inspector](https://dmichos.github.io/pro/jwt-inspector.html)**: A privacy-first tool for decoding and inspecting JSON Web Tokens entirely within the browser.
*   **[XSS Weaponizer](https://dmichos.github.io/pro/xss-weaponizer.html)**: A library of elite XSS polyglots and a custom obfuscator (URL, HTML, Hex) designed to bypass modern WAFs and security filters.
*   **[Exploit Pattern Creator](https://dmichos.github.io/pro/exploit-pattern.html)**: Generate unique De Bruijn sequences for buffer overflow analysis and quickly find memory offsets from register values.
*   **[Security Header Analyst](https://dmichos.github.io/pro/header-analyst.html)**: Audit HTTP response headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.) to identify missing security configurations.
*   **[Hash Identifier & Generator](https://dmichos.github.io/pro/hash-tool.html)**: Identify unknown hash types using regex patterns and generate secure SHA-256/SHA-1 hashes locally.

## 🎓 Cyber Academy
An immersive, terminal-based learning environment featuring interactive missions to master fundamental offensive tools.

### 🔬 Available Labs:
*   **VIM Mastery**: A high-fidelity VIM simulation. Master switching between **Normal**, **Insert**, and **Command** modes while completing buffered text-editing missions.
*   **GDB & Pwntools**: Step into a simulated Python REPL. Learn to load binaries (`ELF`), audit security properties, spawn processes, and craft buffer overflow payloads using `pwntools` primitives within a guided workflow.

---

## 💻 Tech Stack
*   **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Glassmorphism & Cyberpunk aesthetics).
*   **Logic**: JavaScript (ES6+), DOM Manipulation, Web Crypto API.
*   **Animations**: `particles.js` for atmospheric background effects.
*   **Theming**: High-contrast dark mode with custom typography (JetBrains Mono).
